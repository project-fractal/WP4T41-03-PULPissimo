Low-Power Services for PULP.

## Description

PULP is designed around low power operation. ETHZ continuously researches new opportunities to increase the energy efficiency of the provided hardware platforms. Microarchitectural modifications and extensions to the RISC-V platform can be employed to specialize the architecture for a specific application scenario, thus increasing its energy efficiency. 

Additional components can be placed in different power domains, which can be powered down during the sleep mode of the IoT device. 

## Objectives

The component satisfies the objective of the task through: 
* Exploring fine-grained clock and power gating 
* Increasing the energy-efficiency of the platform through microarchitectural modifications and specialized architectures 

## Prerequisites, Installation and Usage

Prerequisites, installation and usage described in the PULPissimo repository.
